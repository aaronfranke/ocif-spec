# Introduction

This document describes the Open Canvas Interchange Format (OCIF), which allows canvas-applications to exchange their data.

**Other Documents** \
For more information about the goals and requirements considered for this spec, see the [Goals](../../design/goals.md), [Requirements](../../design/requirements.md) and [Design Decisions](../../design/design-decisions.md) documents.
**For practical advice on how to use OCIF, see the [OCIF Cookbook](../../cookbook.md).**

**Canvas** \
A canvas in this context is a spatial view, on which visual items are placed.
Often, these items have been placed and sized manually.

There is no formal definition of _(infinite) canvas applications_.
The following references describe the concept:

- https://infinitecanvas.tools/
- https://lucid.co/techblog/2023/08/25/design-for-canvas-based-applications

The goal is to allow different canvas apps to display a canvas exported from other apps, even edit it,
and open again in the first app, without data loss.

In this spec, we define a canvas as consisting of three main parts:

- **[Nodes](#nodes)**: Visual items, placed on the canvas.
- **[Relations](#relations)**: Logical connections between visual items (and other relations).
- **[Resources](#resources)**: Content, such as text, vector drawings, raster images, videos, or audio files.

To make sub-formats explicit, OCIF uses JSON schemas, kept in a fourth part:

- **[Schemas](#schemas)**: Definitions of the structure of nodes and relations.

## Hello World Example

Given two nodes, a rectangle with the word "Berlin" and an oval with "Germany."
We let an arrow point from Berlin to Germany.
The arrow represents a relation of the kind "is capital of."

![Hello World Example image](./hello-world-example.png)

In OCIF, it looks like this:

```json5
{
  ocif: "https://canvasprotocol.org/ocif/v0.5.1-draft",
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "berlin-node",
      position: [100, 100],
      size: [100, 50],
      resource: "berlin-res",
      /* a green rect with a 3 pixel wide black border line */
      data: [
        {
          type: "@ocif/node/rect",
          strokeWidth: 3,
          strokeColor: "#000000",
          fillColor: "#00FF00",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: "germany-node",
      position: [300, 100],
      /* slightly bigger than Berlin */
      size: [100, 60],
      resource: "germany-res",
      /* a white rect with a 5 pixel wide red border line */
      data: [
        {
          type: "@ocif/node/oval",
          strokeWidth: 5,
          strokeColor: "#FF0000",
          fillColor: "#FFFFFF",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: "arrow-1",
      data: [
        {
          type: "@ocif/node/arrow",
          strokeColor: "#000000",
          /* right side of Berlin */
          start: [200, 125],
          /* center of Germany */
          end: [350, 130],
          startMarker: "none",
          endMarker: "arrowhead",
          /* link to relation which is shown by this arrow */
          relation: "relation-1",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  relations: [
    {
      id: "relation-1",
      data: [
        {
          type: "@ocif/rel/edge",
          start: "berlin-node",
          end: "germany-node",
          /* WikiData 'is capital of'.
           We could also omit this or just put the string 'is capital of' here. */
          rel: "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1376",
          /* link back to the visual node representing this relation */
          node: "arrow-1",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  resources: [
    {
      id: "berlin-res",
      representations: [{ "mimeType": "text/plain", content: "Berlin" }],
    },
    {
      id: "germany-res",
      representations: [{ "mimeType": "text/plain", content: "Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª" }],
    },
  ],
}
```

# File Structure

The OCIF file is a JSON object with the following properties:

| Property    | JSON Type | OCIF Type                       | Required     | Contents                          |
|-------------|-----------|:--------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| `ocif`      | `string`  | [URI](#uri)                     | **required** | The URI of the OCIF schema        |
| `rootNode`  | `string`  | [ID](#id)                       | optional     | A canvas root [node](#nodes)      |
| `nodes`     | `array`   | [Node](#node)[]                 | optional     | A list of [nodes](#nodes)         |

| `schemas`   | `array`   | [Schema Entry](#schema-entry)[] | optional     | Declared [schemas](#schemas)      |

- **OCIF**: The _Open Canvas Interchange Format_ schema URI.
  - The URI SHOULD contain the version number of the schema, either as a version number or as a date (preferred).
  - Known versions:
    - `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.1` Retrospectively assigned URI for the first draft at https://github.com/ocwg/spec/blob/initial-draft/README.md
    - `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.2` This is a preliminary version, as described in this draft, for experiments
    - `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.3` This is the first stable version.
- **rootNode**: An optional [root node](#root-node) id. It MUST point to a node defined within the `nodes` array.
- **nodes**: A list of nodes on the canvas. See [Nodes](#nodes) for details.
- **relations**: A list of relations between nodes (and relations). See [Relations](#relations) for details.
- **resources**: A list of resources used by nodes. See [Resources](#resources) for details.
- **schemas**: A list of schema entries, which are used for relation types and extensions. See [Schemas](#schemas) for details.

JSON schema: [schema.json](schema.json)

**Example** \
A minimal OCIF file, no visible items

```json
{
  "ocif": "https://canvasprotocol.org/ocif/v0.5.1-draft"
}
```

**Example** \
A small OCIF file, with one node and one resource

```json
{
  "ocif": "https://canvasprotocol.org/ocif/v0.5.1-draft",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "position": [100, 100],
      "resource": "r1"
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "r1",
      "representations": [{ "mimeType": "text/plain", "content": "Hello, World!" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Nodes

Nodes represent visual items on the canvas.
Conceptually, a node is a rectangle (bounding box) on the canvas, often displaying some content (resource).
A _Node_ is an `object` with the following properties:

| Property       | JSON Type | OCIF Type                         | Required     | Contents                            | Default     |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `id`           | `string`  | [ID](#id)                         | **required** | A unique identifier for the node.   | n/a         |
| `position`     | `array`   | number[]                          | recommended  | Coordinate as (x,y) or (x,y,z).     | [0,0]       |
| `size`         | `array`   | number[]                          | recommended  | The size of the node per dimension. | `[100,100]` |
| `resource`     | `string`  | [ID](#id)                         | optional     | The resource to display             |             |
| `resourceFit` | `string`  | enum, see below                   | optional     | Fitting resource in item            | `contain`   |
| `data`         | `array`   | array of [Extension](#extensions) | optional     | Extended node data                  |             |
| `rotation`     | `number`  | [Angle](#angle)                   | optional     | +/- 360 degrees                     | `0`         |
| `relation`     | `string`  | [ID](#id)                         | optional     | ID of a [relation](#relation)       | n/a         |

NOTE: JSON numbers allow integer and floating-point values, so does OCIF.

- **id**: A unique identifier for the node. Must be unique within an OCIF file. See [ID](#ocif-types) type for details.

- **position**: The position of the node on the canvas.

  - Required are **x** (at position `0`) and **y** (at position `1`). Optional is **z** at position `2`.
  - The _coordinate system_ has the x-axis pointing to the right, the y-axis pointing down, and the z-axis pointing away from the screen. This is the same as in CSS, SVG, and most 2D and 3D graphics libraries. The origin is the top-left corner of the canvas.
  - The unit is logical pixels (as used in CSS for `px`).
  - The positioned point (to which the `position` refers) is the top-left corner of the node.
  - The position is global. (The computation for this position can _additionally_ be stated using the [node transforms](extensions.md#node-transforms) extension).
  - The default for z-axis is `0` when importing 2D as 3D.
  - When importing 3D as 2D, the z-axis is ignored (but can be left as-is). When a position is changed, the z-axis CAN be set to 0. Yes, this implies that full round-tripping is not always possible.
  - Values on all three axes can be negative.

- **size**: The size of the node in dimensions. I.e., this is **x-axis** ("width" at position `0`), **y-axis** ("height" at position `1`), and **z-axis** ("depth" at position `2`).

  - Size might be omitted if a linked resource defines the size. E.g., raster images such as PNG an JPEG define their size in pixels. SVG can have a `viewbox` defined, but may also omit it. Text can be wrapped at any width, so a size property is clearly required. In general, a size property is really useful as a fall-back to display at least a kind of rectangle if the resource cannot be displayed as intended. Size can only be omitted if _all_ resource representations define a size.\
  - See also [Size and Resource](#size-and-resource)

- **data**: Additional properties of the node.
  A node may have any number of extensions. Each extension is a JSON object with a `type` property.
  See [extensions](#extensions).

- **resource**: A reference to a resource, which can be an image, video, or audio file. See [resources](#resources).

  - Resource can be empty, in which case a node is acting as a transform for other nodes.
  - Resource content is cropped/limited by the nodes boundaries. This is commonly called _clip children_. Only in this respect the resource content is a kind of child. In CSS, this is called `overflow: hidden`.

  - Resources can define ornamental borders, e.g. a rectangle has a rectangular border, or an [oval](#oval) defines an oval border. The border itself is z-ordered in front of the resource content.

- **resourceFit**: Given a node with dimensions 100 (height) x 200 (width) and a bitmap image (e.g., a .png) with a size of 1000 x 1000.
  How should this image be displayed? We re-use some options from CSS ([object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property):

  - `none`: All pixels are displayed in the available space unscaled. The example would be cropped down to the 100 x 200 area top-left. No auto-centering.
  - `containX`: Scaled by keeping the aspect ratio, so that the image width matches the item width. This results in the image being displayed at a scale of `0.2`, so that it is 200 px wide and 200 px heigh.
   This is called `keep-width` in Godot.
  - `containY`: Scaled by keeping the aspect ratio, so that the image height matches the item height. This results in the image being displayed at a scale of `0.1`, so that it is 100 px high and 100 px wide. The image is now fully visible, but there are boxes of empty space left and right of the image.
   This is called `keep-height` in Godot.
  - `contain`: Scaled by keeping the aspect ratio of the image, so that the image fits into the item for both height and width.
    The image is auto-centered vertically and horizontally.
    Empty space left and right or top and bottom might appear.
    NOTE: This is identical to auto-selecting one of the two previous options.
    This is called 'keep aspect centered' in Godot.
  - `cover`: Scaled by keeping the aspect ratio of the image, so that the image fits into the item for one of height and width while the other dimension overlaps. The overlap is cropped away and not visible. The entire view area is filled.
  - `fill`: Aspect ratio is ignored and the image is simply stretched to match the width and height of the view box.
  - `tile`: If the image is larger than the viewport, it just gets cropped. If it is smaller, it gets repeated in both dimensions. CSS calls this `background-repeat: repeat`.

- **rotation**: The absolute, global 2D rotation of the node in degrees. The rotation center is the positioned point, i.e., top-left. The z-axis is not modified.

- **relation**:
  The ID of the relation defining the semantics of the visual node (e.g., an [arrow](#arrow)).
  The [relation](#relation) should point back to this visual node using its `node` property.
  - Deletion semantics: If a visual node is deleted, which has a `relation` stated, that underlying relation should also be deleted.


## Size and Resource
Conceptually, a node has a position (top-left) and a size.
The node position is interpreted as the root of a local coordinate system.
The size of the node is interpreted in the global coordinate system.
This yields a rectangle (bounding box) acting as a clipping mask on the contents of the node.

A node may display a resource.
This resource may have an intrinsic size (bitmap image) or at least a given aspect-ratio (vector graphics without an explicit size) or have not stated its size (text or formatted text).
For text resources, the text settings (e.g., font size and line height) define how text is wrapped and displayed in the available space.

The `scale` factor can also be manually overwritten using the [node transforms](extensions.md#node-transforms).


## Text Nodes?

There is no special text node in OCIF. Text is just a resource, which can be displayed by any node.
See [Resources](#resources) for details on text resources.

**Example:** A node showing "Hello, World!" as text.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "position": [300, 200],
      "resource": "r1"
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "r1",
      "representations": [
        {
          "mimeType": "text/plain",
          "content": "Hello, World!"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

TIP: Additional node extensions (e.g. [Rectangle](#rectangle)) can be used to "style" the text node, e.g., by adding a background color or a border.

## Image Nodes?

There is no special image node in OCIF. An image is just a resource, which can be displayed by any node.

**Example:** A node showing an image.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "position": [300, 200],
      "resource": "r1"
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "r1",
      "representations": [
        {
          "mimeType": "image/png",
          "location": "https://example.com/image.png"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

TIP: Additional node extensions can be used. E.g., an [Oval](#oval) could be used to display the image cropped as a circle.

## Rectangle

- Name: `@ocif/node/rect`
- URI: `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/rect-node.json`

A rectangle is a visual node [extension](#extensions), to define the visual appearance of a node as a rectangle.
A core node has already a position, size, rotation, scale.

| Property      | JSON Type | OCIF Type       | Required | Contents                 | Default   |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| `strokeWidth` | `number`  | number          | optional | The line width.          | `1`       |
| `strokeColor` | `string`  | [Color](#color) | optional | The color of the stroke. | `#FFFFFF` |
| `fillColor`   | `string`  | [Color](#color) | optional | The color of the fill.   | (none)    |

- **strokeWidth**:
  The line width in logical pixels. Default is `1`. Inspired from SVG `stroke-width`.
- **strokeColor**:
  The color of the stroke. Default is white (`#FFFFFF`). Inspired from SVG `stroke`.
- **fillColor**:
  The color of the fill. Default is none / fully transparent.

z-order: The stroke (`strokeWidth`, `strokeColor`) SHOULD be rendered "on top" of a resource, while the fill (`fillColor`) SHOULD be rendered "behind" the resource.
So a _fillColor_ can be used for a background-color.

These properties are meant to customize the built-in default stroke of a canvas app.
I.e., if all shapes in a canvas app are red and a node is using the rectangle extension but defines no color, the node should be red as well. The defaults listed in the table are just examples and can be different in different canvas apps.

JSON schema: [rect-node.json](core/rect-node.json)

## Oval

- Name: `@ocif/node/oval`
- URI: `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/oval-node.json`

An oval is a visual node extension, to define the visual appearance of a node as an oval.
An oval in a square bounding box is a circle.

An oval has the exact same properties as a [Rectangle](#rectangle), just the rendering is different.
The oval shall be rendered as an ellipse, within the bounding box defined by the node's position and size.

JSON schema: [oval-node.json](core/oval-node.json)

## Arrow

- Name: `@ocif/node/arrow`
- URI: `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/arrow-node.json`

An arrow is a visual node that connects two point coordinates.
It should be rendered as a straight line, with optional direction markers at the start and end.

| Property      | JSON Type | OCIF Type       | Required     | Contents                | Default   |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| `strokeWidth` | `number`  | number          | optional     | The line width.         | `1`       |
| `strokeColor` | `string`  | [Color](#color) | optional     | The color of the arrow. | `#FFFFFF` |
| `start`       | `array`   | number[]        | **required** | The start point.        | n/a       |
| `end`         | `array`   | number[]        | **required** | The end point.          | n/a       |
| `startMarker` | `string`  | string          | optional     | Marker at the start.    | `none`    |
| `endMarker`   | `string`  | string          | optional     | Marker at the end.      | `none`    |

- **strokeWidth**:
  The line width in logical pixels. Default is `1`. Inspired from SVG `stroke-width`.

- **strokeColor**:
  The color of the arrow. Default is white (`#FFFFFF`). Inspired from SVG `stroke`.

- **start**:
  The start point of the arrow. The array contains the x and y coordinates. \
  The z-coordinate, if present, is used only in 3D canvas apps.

- **end**:
  The end point of the arrow. The array contains the x and y coordinates. \
  The z-coordinate, if present, is used only in 3D canvas apps.

- **startMarker**:
  The marker at the start of the arrow.
  Possible values are:

  - `none`: No special marker at the start. A flat line at the start.
  - `arrowhead`: An arrow head at the start. The arrow head points at the start point.

- **endMarker**:
  The marker at the end of the arrow.
  Possible values are:

  - `none`: No special marker at the end. A flat line end at the end.
  - `arrowhead`: An arrow head at the end. The arrow head points at the end point.

NOTE on **position** and **size**:
An arrow should only include a position if a [resource](#resource) is stated to represent this arrow.
The geometric properties (start and end) often suffice.


The markers allow representing four kinds of arrow:

| startMarker | endMarker | Visual              |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| none        | none      | start `-------` end |
| none        | arrowhead | start `------>` end |
| arrowhead   | none      | start `<------` end |
| arrowhead   | arrowhead | start `<----->` end |

NOTE: Canvas apps can use any visual shape for the markers, as long as the direction is clear.

## Path

- Name: `@ocif/node/path`
- URI: `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/path-node.json`

A path is a visual node extension, to define the visual appearance of a node as a path.
The rendering of resources inside a path is not defined by OCIF, but by the canvas app.

| Property      | JSON Type | OCIF Type       | Required     | Contents               | Default   |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------|
| `strokeWidth` | `number`  | number          | optional     | The line width.        | `1`       |
| `strokeColor` | `string`  | [Color](#color) | optional     | The color of the path. | `#FFFFFF` |
| `fillColor`   | `string`  | [Color](#color) | optional     | The color of the fill. | `none`    |
| `path`        | `string`  | string          | **required** | The path data.         | n/a       |

- **strokeWidth**:
  The line width in logical pixels. Default is `1`. Inspired from SVG `stroke-width`.

- **strokeColor**:
  The color of the path. Default is white (`#FFFFFF`). Inspired from SVG `stroke`.

- **fillColor**:
  The color of the fill. Default is none / fully transparent. Applies only to closed or self-intersecting paths.

- **path**:
  The path data, like the SVG path data `d` attribute. The path data is a string, which can contain the following commands:
  - `M x y`: Move to position x, y
  - `L x y`: Line to position x, y
  - `C x1 y1 x2 y2 x y`: Cubic Bezier curve to x, y with control points x1, y1 and x2, y2
  - `Q x1 y1 x y`: Quadratic BÃ©zier curve to x, y with control point x1, y1
  - `A rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y`: Arc to x, y with radii rx, ry, x-axis-rotation, large-arc-flag, sweep-flag
  - `Z`: Close the path
  - The starting point of the path is the top-left corner of the node, i.e., the positioned point.

NOTE: Canvas apps can simplify rendering of curves (cubic/quadratic bezier, arc) to straight lines.

JSON schema: [path-node.json](core/path-node.json)


## Root Node
Every canvas has a defined or implied _root node_.
The root node itself SHOULD not be rendered, only its interior.
If no root node is defined, an implied root with ID `rootNode` is used.

All text styles are already defined as default values of optional properties in the [text style](extensions.md#text-style-node) extension. A root node can define these values to set custom standard values for a whole canvas.

The root node 'contains' all nodes that are not explicitly contained by another node.
"Contain" in this context refers to the [parent-child](extensions.md#parent-child-relation) relation.

The `size` property of the root node effectively defines a canvas size, much like the [viewbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/coords.html#ViewBoxAttribute of an SVG file).
The coordinate system of a node always starts at the top-left corner at (0,0). So the `position` attribute of the root node has no effect.


### Nesting Canvases
A [node](#node) 'A' in a canvas (now called 'host canvas') may use a [resource](#resource) of type `application/ocif+json` (the [recommended IANA MIME type](#practical-recommendations) for OCIF files). That resource defines another canvas (now called 'sub-canvas'). Per definition, the sub-canvas has an explicit or implicit [root node](#root-node).
From the perspective of the host canvas, node 'A' and the sub-canvas root node **are the same node**.

The properties of the **host** canvas node 'A' extend and overwrite the properties of the imported **child** canvas root node. This allows to re-use existing canvases in different ways.
That is, the host node 'A' is interpreted as a JSON Merge Patch ([RFC 7396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7396)) document against the sub-canvas root node.
There is one exception: `data`-extension arrays are always _merged_:
Both arrays are appended, first the sub-canvas root nodes extensions, then the host nodes 'A' extensions.
Later entries overwrite earlier entries for the same `type` of extension.

#### Partial Export
NOTE: When exporting a node from a canvas (and all its child nodes per parent-child relation), that node should become the root node of the exported sub-canvas. For consistency, all effective values, which may be inherited, need to be copied onto the exported root node.


# Relations

Relations are used to indicate relationships between Nodes on the canvas.
They can also be used to indicate relationships between other relations.
Relations are generally not visible but rather conceptual.
If a relation should be visualized, it should have a corresponding Node.

Every relation has the following properties:

| Property | JSON Type | OCIF Type                | Required     | Contents                                             |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`     | `string`  | [ID](#id)                | **required** | A unique identifier for the relation.                |
| `data`   | `array`   | [Extension](#extensions) | optional     | Additional data for the relation.                    |
| `node`   | `string`  | [ID](#id)                | optional     | ID of a visual node, which represents this relation. |

Similar to nodes, there is a built-in base relation, which can use extensions.
Contrary to nodes, the base extension has no pre-defined properties except the `id` and `data` properties.
Thus, relations are very flexible.

- **id**:
  A unique identifier for the relation.
  Must be unique within an OCIF file.
  See [ID](#ocif-types) type for details.

- **data**:
  Additional data for the relation.
  Each array entry is an _extension object_, which is the same for nodes and relations.
  See [extensions](#extensions).

- **node**:
  The ID of a node, which represents this relation visually.
  E.g., often an arrow shape is used to represent an [edge relation](#edge-relation).
  - If a visual node is used to represent a relation, the visual node should point back via its `relation` to this relation ID.
  - Semantics: If a relation (e.g., arrow or group) is deleted, which points to a `node`, that node should also be deleted.

In the remainder of this section, the current list of relation extension types (also just called _relation types_) is explained.
In addition to the relation types defined here, anybody can define and use their own relation types.
If this is your first read of the spec, skip over the details of the relation types and come back to them later.

## Group Relation

- Name: `@ocif/rel/group`
- URI: `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/group-rel.json`

A group relation is a relation that groups nodes together.
Groups are known as "Groups" in most canvas apps,
"Groups" in Godot, and "Tags" in Unity.

A group has the following properties in its `data` object:

| Property        | JSON Type | OCIF Type   | Required     | Contents                    |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| `members`       | `array`   | [ID](#id)[] | **required** | IDs of members of the group |
| `cascadeDelete` | `boolean` | `boolean`   | **optional** | `true` or `false`           |

- **members**: A list of IDs of nodes or other groups that are part of the group.
  Resources cannot be part of a group.
- **cascadeDelete**: A boolean flag indicating if deleting the group should also delete all members of the group.
  If `true`, deleting the group will also delete all members of the group.
  If `false`, deleting the group will not delete its members.

**Example:** A group of 3 nodes with letters for names:

```json
{
  "id": "letter_named_nodes",
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "@ocif/rel/group",
      "members": [
        "A",
        "B",
        "C"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Groups can contain groups as members. Thus, all semantics apply recursively.
- When a group is deleted, if `"cascadeDelete"` is `true`, all members are deleted as well.
- When a group is 'ungrouped,' the group itself is deleted, but its members remain.
- When a member is deleted, it is removed from the group.

JSON schema: [group-rel.json](core/group-rel.json)

## Edge Relation

- Name: `@ocif/rel/edge`
- URI: `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/edge-rel.json`

An edge relates two elements (nodes and/or relation, mixing types is allowed).
It supports directed and undirected bi-edges.

It has the following properties (in addition to standard [relation](#relation) properties):

| Property   | JSON Type | OCIF Type | Required     | Contents                  | Default |
|------------|-----------|:----------|--------------|---------------------------|:--------|
| `start`    | `string`  | [ID](#id) | **required** | ID of source element.     |         |
| `end`      | `string`  | [ID](#id) | **required** | ID of target element.     |         |
| `directed` | `boolean` |           | optional     | Is the edge directed?     | `true`  |
| `rel`      | `string`  |           | optional     | Represented relation type |         |
| `node`     | `string`  | [ID](#id) | optional     | ID of a visual node       |         |

- **start**: The ID of the source element.
- **end**: The ID of the target element.
- **directed**: A boolean flag indicating if the edge is directed. If `true`, the edge is directed from the source to the target. If `false`, the edge is undirected. Default is `true`.
- **rel**: The type of relation represented by the edge. This is optional but can be used to indicate the kind of relation between the source and target elements. Do not confuse with the `type` of the OCIF relation. This field allows representing an RDF triple (subject, predicate, object) as (start,rel,end).

JSON schema: [edge-rel.json](core/edge-rel.json)

# Assets

OCIF knows two kinds of assets, [resources](#resources) and [schemas](#schemas). Both are managed by similar mechanisms. Assets can be stored in three ways:

- **Inline**: The asset is stored directly in the OCIF file. It is referenced by its id.
- **External**: The asset is stored in a separate file, which is referenced by the OCIF file. A relative URI expresses the reference.
- **Remote**: The asset is stored on a remote server, which is referenced by the OCIF file. A URI is required as a reference.

## Resources

Resources are the hypermedia assets that nodes display.
They are stored separately from Nodes to allow for asset reuse and efficiency.

Resources can be referenced by nodes or relations.
They are stored in the `resources` property of the OCIF file.
Typical resources are, e.g., SVG images, text documents, or media files.

- Each entry in `resources` is an array of _representation_ objects.
- The order of representations is significant. The first representation is the default representation.
  Later representations can be used as fallbacks.

A resource is an `object` with the following properties:

| Property          | JSON Type | OCIF Type                           | Required     | Contents                        |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| `id`              | `string`  | [ID](#id)                           | **required** | Identifier of the resource      |
| `representations` | `array`   | [Representation](#representation)[] | **required** | Representations of the resource |

- **id**: A unique identifier for the resource. See [ID](#id) type for details.

- **representations**: A list of representations of the resource.

### Representation

Each _Representation_ object has the following properties:

| Property   | JSON Type | OCIF Type               | Required  | Contents                               |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `location` | `string`  | [URI](#uri)             | see below | The storage location for the resource. |
| `mimeType` | `string`  | [MIME Type](#mime-type) | see below | The IANA MIME Type of the resource.    |
| `content`  | `string`  |                         | see below | The content of the resource.           |

Either `content` or `location` MUST be present. If `content` is used, `location` must be left out and vice versa.

- **location**: The storage location for the resource.
  This can be a relative URI for an external resource or an absolute URI for a remote resource.
  - If a `data:` URI is used, the `content` and `mimeType` properties are implicitly defined already. Values in `content` and `mimeType` are ignored.
- **mimeType**: The IANA MIME Type of the resource. See [MIME Type](#mime-type) for details.
- **content**: The content of the resource.
  This is the actual data of the resource as a string.
  It can be base64-encoded.

**Summary** \
Valid resource representations are

|                 | `location`                      | `mimeType`                                                 | `content`          |
|:----------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Inline text     | Ignored, `content` is set       | E..g. `text/plain` or `image/svg+xml`                      | Text/SVG as string |
| Inline binary   | Ignored, `content` is set       | E.g. `image/png`                                           | Base64             |
| Remote          | `https://example.com/sunny.png` | Optional; obtained from HTTP response                      | Ignored            |
| External        | `images/sunny.png`              | Recommended; only guessable from file extension or content | Ignored            |
| Remote data URI | `data:image/png;base64,...`     | Ignored; present in URI                                    | Ignored            |

**Example:** A resource stored inline:

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "r1",
      "representations": [{ "mimeType": "image/svg+xml", "content": "<svg>...</svg>" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fallback

**Example**: A resource with a fallback representation.

- The first representation is an SVG image, stored inline.
- The second representation is a remotely stored PNG image. If SVG content cannot be rendered by the application, the PNG can be used.
- The third representation is a text representation of the resource. This can be used for accessibility or indexing purposes.

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "r1",
      "representations": [
        { "mimeType": "image/svg+xml", "content": "<svg>...</svg>" },
        {
          "mimeType": "image/png",
          "location": "https://example.com/image.png"
        },
        { "mimeType": "text/plain", "content": "Plan of the maze" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schemas

A schema in this specification refers to a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) 2020-12.

Schemas are used to define

- a whole OCIF document,
  - Due to the openness of OCIF, the JSON schema for the OCIF document cannot capture all possible extensions.
- the structure of [extensions](#extensions).

Schemas are stored either inline in the `schemas` property of an OCIF document or externally/remote. See [assets](#assets) for storage options.

Each entry in the `schemas` array is an object with the following properties:

| Property   | JSON Type | OCIF Type                   | Required     | Contents                                 |
|------------|-----------|:----------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `uri`      | `string`  | absolute [URI](#uri)        | **required** | Identifier (and location) of the schema  |
| `schema`   | `object`  |                             | optional     | JSON schema inline as a JSON object      |
| `location` | `string`  | [URI](#uri)                 | optional     | Override storage location for the schema |
| `name`     | `string`  | [Schema Name](#schema-name) | optional     | Optional shortname for a schema. "@..."  |

- **uri**: The URI of the schema. The URI SHOULD be absolute. Only for local testing or development, relative URIs MAY be used.

  - The URI SHOULD contain the version number of the schema, either as a version number or as a date.

- **schema**: The actual JSON schema as a JSON object. This is only required for inline schemas. If `schema` is used, `location` must be left out.

- **location**: The storage location for the schema.

  - For a schema stored inline, this property should be left out.
  - For a _remote_ schema, the `uri` property is used as a location. This field allows overriding the location with another URL. This is particularly useful for testing or development.
  - An _external_ schema uses a relative URI as a location. This is a relative path to the OCIF file.

- **name**: An optional short name for the schema. This defines an alias to the URI. It is useful for human-readable references to the schema. The name MUST start with a `@` character. Names SHOULD use the convention organisation name `/` type (`node` or `rel`) `/` schema name. Example name: `@example/node/circle` (not needed, use an [oval](#oval) instead). Names MUST be unique within an OCIF file.
  - By convention, schema names do not contain a version number. However, if multiple versions of the same schema are used in a file, the version number MUST be appended to the name to distinguish between them. E.g. `@example/circle/1.0` and `@example/circle/1.1`.

A JSON schema file may contain more than one type definition (under the `$defs` property).
When referencing a schema URI, there are two options:

- `https://example.com/myschema.json` refers to a schema defining only one (main) type. Implicitly, the first type is addressed.
- `https://example.com/myschema.json#typename` is formally understood as a JSON pointer expression (`/$defs/` _typename_ ) , which refers to a specific type definition within the schema.

To summarize, these schema definitions are possible:

| Schema        | `uri`        | `schema`        | `location`                   | `name`   |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------|----------|
| Inline Schema | **required** | the JSON schema | --                           | optional |
| External      | **required** | --              | relative path                | optional |
| Remote        | **required** | --              | -- (URI is used)             | optional |
| Remote        | **required** | --              | absolute URI (overrides URI) | optional |

By defining a mapping of URIs to names, the OCIF file becomes more readable and easier to maintain.

**Example** \
A schema array with two schemas:

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/node/ports/0.2",
      "name": "@ocif/node/ports"
    },
    {
      "uri": "https://example.com/ns/ocif-node/circle/1.0",
      "location": "schemas/circle.json",
      "name": "@example/circle"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Built-in Schema Mappings
The syntax `{var}` denotes placeholders.
To simplify the use of OCIF, a set of built-in schema mappings is defined:

1. Any [Schema Name](#schema-name) of the form `@ocif/rel/{suffix}` maps to a schema [URI](#uri) `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/{suffix}-rel.json`.

2. A schema name of the form `@ocif/node/{suffix}` maps to a schema URI `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/{suffix}-node.json`.

Here `v0.5.1-draft` is the current version identifier of the OCIF spec. Later OCIF specs will have different versions and thus different URIs.

Built-in Entries:

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "name": "@ocif/node/${ext-type}",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/${ext-type}-node.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/rel/${ext-type}",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/${ext-type}-rel.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

These mappings SHOULD be materialized into the OCIF JSON schema.

# Extensions

No two canvas applications are alike:
There are apps for informal whiteboarding, formal diagramming, quick visual sketches, node-and-wire programming, and many other use cases.
Each of these apps has radically different feature sets.
Extensions are an integral part of OCIF.
They allow adding custom data to nodes, relations, and resources.

- An extension is a JSON object (used as a "property bag") with one mandatory property: `type`.
  Thus, `type` is a reserved property key.
  All other property keys can be used by the extension.
- Arbitrary, nested JSON structures are allowed.
- Extensions SHOULD define how the base properties play together with the extension properties and with other (known) extensions.
- Nodes and relations can have multiple extensions within their `data` array.
- Each extension is an object with a `type` property.

| Property | JSON Type | OCIF Type                                  | Required     | Contents          |
|----------|-----------|:-------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `type`   | `string`  | [Schema Name](#schema-name) or [URI](#uri) | **required** | Type of extension |

- **type**: The type of the extension. This is a URI or a simple name.
  If a name is used, that name must be present in the [schemas](#schemas) section, where it is mapped to a URI.

For an example of an extension, see the [appendix](#appendix), [Node Extension: Circle](#node-extension-circle).

## Defining Extensions

If you need to store some extra data at a node for your canvas app, and none of the existing extensions fit, you can define your own extension.

An extension MUST have a URI (as its ID) and a document describing the extension.

It SHOULD have a version number, as part of its URI.
It SHOULD have a proposed name and SHOULD have a JSON schema.

The proposed structure is to use a directory in a git repository.
The directory path should contain a name and version number.
Within the repo, there SHOULD be two files:

- README.md, which describes the extension.
- schema.json, which contains the JSON schema for the extension.
  - This schema MUST use the same URI as the extension.
  - It SHOULD have a `description` property, describing briefly the purpose of the extension.
  - It MAY have a `title`. If a title is used, it should match the proposed short name, e.g. `@ocif/node/oval` or `@ocif/node/ports/v0.5.1-draft`.

As an example, look at the fictive [Circle Extension](#node-extension-circle) in the appendix.

### How To Write an Extension Step-by-Step

- Define the properties of the extension. What data is added to a node or relation?
- Define the URI of the extension. Ideally, this is where you publish your JSON schema file.
- Write a text describing the intended semantics.
- Create a JSON schema that defines the structure of the extension data. Large language models are a great help here.

To publish an extension, a version number should be included.
It is good practice to use a directory structure that reflects the version number of the extension.
Within the directory, the text is usually stored as a Markdown file, which links to the JSON schema.
The OCIF [extensions document](extensions.md) currently describes several OCIF extensions in one document, which is also possible.

**Example for a file structure**

```
/1.0
  /README.md      <-- your documentation
  /schema.json    <-- your JSON schema
```

## Exporting Data with Extensions

When exporting an OCIF file using extensions, the application SHOULD use inline or external schemas for the extensions.
Remote schemas CAN be used to save space in the OCIF file.

## Handling Extension Data

To support interchange between canvases when features don't overlap,
canvas apps need to preserve nodes and relations that they don't support:

- Canvas A supporting Feature X creates a canvas with a Feature X node in it and exports it as OCIF.
- Canvas B, which does not support Feature X, opens the OCIF file, and some edits are made to the canvas.
- Canvas B exports the canvas to an OCIF file. The nodes for Feature X should still be in the OCIF file, unchanged.

Vital parts of the OCIF format are modelled as extensions.
In the following sections, extensions defined within this specification are listed.

# OCIF Types

The _JSON types_ are just: `object`, `array`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`.
OCIF defines more precise types, e.g., _ID_ is a JSON string with additional semantic (must be unique within a document).
We also use the syntax `ID[]` to refer to a JSON `array`, in which each member is an _ID_.

Here is the catalog of types used throughout the document (in alphabetical order):

## Angle

A `number` that represents an angle between -360 and 360.
The angle is measured in degrees, with positive values (0,360] indicating a clockwise rotation and negative values [-360,0) indicating a counterclockwise rotation.
Numbers outside the range [-360, 360] are allowed, but they are normalized into the range by adding or subtracting 360 until the value is within the range.

## Color

A `string` that encodes a color. CSS knows many ways to define colors, other formats usually less.
As a minimum, the syntax `#010203` should be understood as marker (`#`), red channel (`01`), green channel (`02`), and blue channel (`03`). Each channel is a value in the range 0 to 255, encoded as hex (`00` to `ff`). Uppercase and lowercase letters are valid to use in hex color definitions, with no difference in interpretation.
A canvas app SHOULD also allow stating four channels, with the fourth channel the _alpha_ channel, which encodes (partial) transparency. Example: `#ed80e930` is "orchid" with ca. 19% transparency.
The color is expressed in the [sRGB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RGB) color space.

## ID

A `string` that represents a unique identifier.
It must be unique among all IDs used in an OCIF document.
The ID space is shared among nodes, relations, and resources.

NOTE: An OCIF file itself can be used as a resource representation. Thus, a node can show a (then nested) other OCIF file. The ID uniqueness applies only within each OCIF file, not across document boundaries.

## MIME Type

A `string` that represents the _MIME Type_ for a resource.
Typical examples in a canvas are `text/plain`, `text/html`, `image/svg+xml`, `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `video/mp4`.
IANA content type registry: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

## Node

An `object` representing a visual [node](#nodes).

## Relation

An `object` representing a [relation](#relations).

## Representation

An `object` representing a [resource](#resources) representation.

## Resource

An `array` of [resource](#resources).

## Schema Entry

An `object` representing a [schema](#schemas) entry.
Schema entries assign schema _URIs_ to _Schema Names_.

## Schema Name

A `string` that represents the name of a schema.
It must be _defined_ in the [schemas](#schemas) section of an OCIF document as a `name` property.
It can be _used_ as `type` of relation, `type` of relation extension, or `type` of node extension.

## URI

A `string` that represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as defined in [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

## Vector
The whole canvas is interpreted either as 2D or 3D.

- A 3D vector is represented using an `array` with three `number` in them, with `v[0]` as _x_, `v[1]` as _y_, and `v[2]` as _z_.
- A 2D vector is represented using an `array` with two `number` in them, with `v[0]` as _x_ and `v[1]` as _y_. In 2D, the z-axis coordinate SHOULD be used for relative z-index ordering of 2D shapes. An application MAY also ignore the z-axis. A 2D vector interpreted as 3D is auto-extend with z-axis set to `0`.

- Syntax shortcut: A vector given as a single number, e.g. `3` is auto-extended to apply uniformly to all dimensions, e.g., `[3,3,3]`. This is most useful for a `scale` factor.



# Practical Recommendations

- The proposed MIME-type for OCIF files is `application/ocif+json`.
<!-- IANA registration https://github.com/ocwg/spec/issues/13 -->

- The recommended file extension for OCIF files is `.ocif.json`.
  This launches JSON-aware applications by default on most systems.
  The extension `.ocif` is also allowed.

- Parsing:

  - If [IDs](#id) collide, the first defined ID should be used.
    This is a simple rule, which allows for deterministic behavior.
    A warning SHOULD be emitted.

- Schema hosting:

  - A schema MUST have a [URI](#uri) as its identifier.
  - A schema SHOULD be hosted at its URI.
    - [purl.org](https://purl.archive.org/) provides a free service for stable, resolvable URIs. This requires URIs to start with `purl.org`.
  - A schema can solely exist in an OCIF file, in the [schemas](#schemas) entry. This is useful for private schemas or for testing.

  - **Recommendation**: As a good practice, "Cool URIs" (see [references](#references)) should provide services for humans and machines. Given a request to `https://example.com/schema`, the server can decide based on the HTTP `Accept`-header:

    - `application/json` -> Send JSON schema via a redirect to, e.g. `https://example.com/schema.json`
    - `text/html` -> Send a human-readable HTML page via a redirect to, e.g. `https://example.com/schema.html`.
    - See [OCWG URL Structure](#ocwg-url-structure-planned) for a proposed URI structure for OCIF resources.

  - Versioning: Note that relation types have a version and extensions to a relation type have another version themselves.

# Appendix

## Built-in Schema Entries

The materialized list of schema entries, as explained in [built-in schema mappings](#built-in-schema-mappings).
Note that core extensions have no version number of their own (in the short name).
They are versioned together with the OCIF spec.
The following block can be assumed to be present in every OCIF document.
It is also valid to additionally copy these schema entries in.

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "name": "@ocif/node/arrow",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/arrow-node.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/node/oval",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/oval-node.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/node/path",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/path-node.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/node/rect",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/rect-node.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/rel/edge",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/edge-rel.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/rel/group",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/group-rel.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Known extensions and suggested short names

The following block _cannot_ be assumed to be present in every OCIF document.
All used extensions must be linked in the schema section.
For an updated list of known extensions, see the [catalog.md](../../catalog.md).


```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "name": "@ocif/rel/hyperedge/0.4.1",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/extensions/hyperedge-rel.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/rel/parent-child/0.4.1",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/extensions/parent-child-rel.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/node/ports/0.4.1",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/extensions/ports-node.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "@ocif/node/relative/0.4.1",
      "uri": "https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/extensions/relative-node.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Examples

### Node Extension: Circle

This fictive example extension defines geometric circles. In reality, a circle in OCIF can be represented as an [oval](#oval) with the same width and height.

- Schema: http://example.com/ns/ocif-node/circle/1.0
- Name: `@example/circle`
- Properties:

| Property | JSON Type | Required | Contents                    | Default |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------------------|--------:|
| `radius` | number    | optional | The circles radius in pixel |      10 |

- Semantics:
  - The `radius` property implies a `size`. I.e., a circle of radius _r_ implies a size of _2r_ x _2r_.

**Example** \
A circle node with a radius of 10 pixels:

```json
{
  "type": "@example/circle",
  "radius": 10
}
```

**Example** \
A node, using the circle extension, with a radius of 20 pixels:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "position": [10, 80],
      "size": [40, 40],
      "data": [
        {
          "type": "@example/circle",
          "radius": 20
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Examples

**Example** \
A node using multiple extensions.
A circle has a port at the geometric "top" position.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "position": [10, 80],
      "size": [40, 40],
      "data": [
        {
          "type": "@example/circle",
          "radius": 20
        },
        {
          "type": "@ocif/node/ports",
          "ports": ["p1"]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "p1",
      "position": [30, 80]
    }
  ]
}
```

## OCWG URL Structure (Planned)

- `https://canvasprotocol.org` - info site
- `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org` - specification; REDIRECT to the latest version, e.g. `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/spec.md`
- `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/spec.md` - OCIF specification version; this is also its [URI](#uri). Links in the text to the schema.
- `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/schema.json` - General OCIF JSON schema
- Extension URIs (some selected exemplars):
  - `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/rect-node.json` - URI for the rectangle node extension
  - `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/core/edge-rel.json` - URI for the rectangle relation extension (core)
  - `https://spec.canvasprotocol.org/v0.5.1-draft/extensions/ports-node.json` - The _ports_ extension schema for nodes in version 0.4; this is also its [URI](#uri)

## Syntax Conventions
- All JSON property names are camelCased. This makes it the easiest to name variables in a programming language.

## Changes

### From v0.4 to v0.5.1-draft

**Core Specification Changes:**
- Removed `node.scale` property - moved to `@ocif/node/transforms` extension
- Added `node.resource-fit` property for controlling resource display within nodes
- Added OCIF type `Vector` with support for 2D/3D vectors and scalar shortcuts
- Made `type` property required for all core node and relation extensions
- Made specific properties required in core extensions (e.g., `start`/`end` for arrows, `ports` for ports extension)

**Extension Changes:**
- Removed `@ocif/rel/set` relation - merged functionality into `@ocif/rel/group`
- Added `cascadeDelete` property to group relations
- Removed deprecated `@ocif/node/relative` extension - functionality moved to `@ocif/node/transforms`
- Added `@ocif/node/anchored` - percentage-based positioning relative to parent bounds
- Added `@ocif/node/textstyle` - font styling properties for text rendering
- Added `@ocif/node/transforms` - geometric transforms including scale, offset, and rotation
- Updated extension versioning to use explicit version numbers (e.g., `@ocif/node/ports/0.4.1`)

### From v0.3 to v0.4

- Changed @ocwg to @ocif
- Prefaced all version numbers with `v` as in `v0.5.1-draft`
- Moved node `scale` property to [node transforms](extensions.md#node-transforms) extension.
- Changed from @ocwg (Open Canvas Working Group) to @ocif (Open Canvas Interchange Format) in schema names.
- Prefaced all version numbers with `v` as in `v0.5.1-draft`
- Added release instructions

### From v0.2.1 to v0.3

- Added OCIF type [Color](#color)
- Renamed @ocif/rel/edge properties: `from` -> `start`, `to` -> `end`
- Added arrow node
- Split in core (for interoperability) and extensions (for interchange)
- Added JSON schemas
- Added default sizes for nodes
- Added node extensions for rectangle, oval, arrow, and path
- Documented text and image usage in nodes
- Clarified ID uniqueness
- Updated URI structure (less fancy, easier to implement)

### From v0.2.0 to v0.2.1

- Relation types and relation extensions merged into one. There is now a base relation, which has extensions.
- Node rotation center fixed.
- Schema object to a schema array, see [design decision](../../design/design-decisions.md#list-or-map).

### From v0.1 to v0.2

- Root property `schema_version` renamed to `ocif` -- this is simpler and serves as a kind of "magic" signature, i.e., a JSON document with an "ocif" property near the top is likely an OCIF file.
- Renamed node `properties` to `data` -- this is simpler and more generic.
- Relation property `name` renamed to `type`.
