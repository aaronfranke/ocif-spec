# 2024-05-31 - Jess and Orion notes

Things we need to handle in version 2.0:

- base properties for nodes
- embed attached files

- "extensions" through schemas

- the schema doesn't have a single high-level version number. rather, each of the nodes and relations is defined by a schema with a version
  - every node has a schema associated with it
  - the base spec "includes" all of the node types in `@opencanvas/*`
  - all of the schemas are currently embedded in file itself
  - `x` and `y` are required when implementing a node type, optionally `z`

Node Base class

```ts
type Node = {
  id: string;
  schema: string;
  schema_version: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z?: number;
};
```

## What node extensions are supported in the initial spec?

- [x] text
- [x] shape
  - (all are modeled with x, y, w, h, rotation)
    - rotation in degrees, + or - between 360 and -360, positive is clockwise
  - rectangle
  - ellipse (circle)
  - triangle
  - diamond
  - hexagon
  - capsule (oval in tldraw)
    - a rectangle where the shortest two edges of the object are semi-circles
  - parallelogram
  - star
  - cloud
  - heart
  - arrow
  - checkbox
- [x] arrows (relations are separate)
  - start: x, terminal
  - bend: plus or minus pixels perpendicular from the midpoint of the arrow
    - positive is to the left from the start to the end
- [x] files
  - `file-type`?
    - support both embedded files and references to external sources (URLs, etc)
  - Freehand

## Relations

- groups can be represented by a set relation
  - relations can point to other relations in order to handle things like nested groups
